# TeamOut Fullstack Interview

Welcome to the fullstack home assignment for TeamOut! This README provides a specification about a product feature we would like you to implement.

## General notes

In this interview, we will assess your skills and knowledge in both frontend and backend development. We are looking for candidates who can effectively work on all aspects of a web application.

We also want to test your product vision and autonomy when facing a specification without much details.

We value your time as much as ours so try to **not spend more than 3/4 hours** working on this.

## Expected format

An archive containing your sources with some information on how to run it. Please, do not publish the code publicly on your github profile or somewhere else (github provides private repositories).

You can send the sources to the following email: dev@teamout.com

## Technical constraints

You can use the tech stack of your choice BUT it would be very nice if you could try to match ours:

- [remix.run](https://remix.run/)
- typescript
- [prisma](https://www.prisma.io/)
- [tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/)

## Feature specification

At TeamOut, our goal is to make corporate retreat easy to organize. One of the main feature that would help us enhance our client experience is attendees management.

Once the location and dates are set, our corporate client needs to reference a list of all attendees and gather some information about people like food allergies or room preferences.

We would like you to build a small web application to gather these information and display them in an admin page.

### ToDo

- A event landing page with a form to gather information about the attendees (example: name, email, attending YES / NO, dietary restrictions, check-in ,check-out, flight detail Arrival, flight detail Departure)
- An admin page to display the results in a table

The guidelines are very broad on purpose so you can be creative about styling, architechture etc.
